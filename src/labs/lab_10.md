# Technology Gallery

In this session, we are flipping the roles: you will be leading a discussion
on emerging technologies for web mapping. There is so much these days that is
appearing, changing and evolving in the world of web mapping. Much of it is
hype and quickly goes away; but not all. Some of these trends will go on to
become the new standard in the coming years. Most of it builds on general 
concepts and technologies we have seen in this course. This session will give
us all a taste of what might be around the corner!

## *What is the "technology gallery"?*

The technology gallery is a showcase of emerging technologies and projects in
web mapping. This will cover several areas we have not had time to cover in
the course, but that knowing about them might be useful for you.

Practically speaking, we will run the gallery as a series of [lightning
talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) driven by students and
moderated by the module leader. 

## *Do I need to do anything before the session?*

Yes. There are three things you need to do before the day of the gallery:

- ***Decide how you will work***. The recommended option is that you pair with
  one peer student and, together, complete the presentation. If you prefer it,
  you can do this task on your own.
- ***Pick a project***. Have a look at the list of potential projects and
  choose one that picks your interest, and "claim" it by adding your name on
  "Student" column of the spreadsheet. If you know of a different project that
  might be a good fit, please speak to the module leader, there's a good
  chance it'll be fine.

  You can find the spreadsheet with projects and sign up at:

  NOTE: you will need to be signed into the University of Liverpool Teams to be
  able to access it.

- ***Prepare a lightning talk***. Once you have a partner in crime (or you
  have decided to work on your own) and a project picked, it's time to get
  cracking. First, you will explore the project/tool, ideally play with it and
  experiment to get a first-hand feel of how it works and what its real potential
  is. Once you have a good idea, start thinking of a presentation to
  communicate what you have learnt. There is only **two requirements**:

  1. The total time of the presentation needs to be two minutes max
  1. If you use slides, no more than three

  The presentation should cover the following aspects of your exploration:

  - `Name of the project`
  - `Background` - Who makes it? What is it for? How has it been used?
  - `Availability` - How can you access it and use it? Is it a web tool? Does
    it work on the command line? Is it a package for a programming language?
  - `Areas of application` - What use cases is this good for? What would you
    recommend it for?
  - `Review` - After using it a bit, what do you think of the project? Would
    you use it yourself? Would you recommend it?

  Be creative in structuring your presentation. Do you want to team-present it
  with your team colleague? Absolutely. Would a `.gif` help get an
  idea across? Go for it! A live demo? Maybe, but remember it needs to fit
  into 2 minutes. The ligning talk is a super flexible format, make the most
  of it!

## *How will the session work?*

On the day of the session, have your presentation ready. We will run it as a
live Teams video chat where each student will be able to share their own
screen for the presentation.
